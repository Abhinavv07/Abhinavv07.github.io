    <h1>Software that I use</h1>
    <p>I often use libre softwares.</p>
<div class="arch">
    <h2>Operating System</h2>
    <p>I use a dristibution of GNU/Linux,<a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux </a>an independently developed, general-purpose Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required.</p>
</div>
<div class="texteditor">
   <h2>Text Editor</h2>
    <p> I use both <a href = "https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"> GNU Emacs</a> and <a href = "https://www.vim.org/"> vim </a>.
        I use Emacs for programming and other tasks where I have to keep reading text for long and Vim for short text edits.
